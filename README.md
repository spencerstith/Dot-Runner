# Dot-Runner
This little bit of code runs dots all over the place in straight lines.

### To use:
When program starts, click on a spot where you want the dots to start.
Next, click again (don't click/drag; use two different clicks) in the direction you want the dots to go in. The length of the line will represent the speed of the dots.

*In other words, the vector you create with this line is the velocity vector.*
